// Graph
    // Each item is a node or a vertex
    // Node are connected with edges
    // Create relationships
    // Scaling is difficult

// Directed graph
    // One way direction

// Undirected Graph
    // Multiple direction

// Weighted graphs
    // can have elements in edges

// Unweighted graphs

// Cyclic
    // When you can go to one node to another and circle back

// Acyclic
    // No way to return to starting node
