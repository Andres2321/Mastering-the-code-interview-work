// Queues
    // a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities
    // at one of the sequence and the removal from the other end of the sequence.



// Time Complexity
    // lookup = O(n)
    // enqueue = O(1)
    // dequeue = O(1)
    // peek = O(1)

// FIFO -
    // Firs In First Out

// Can use array to implement
    // Do not implement with array.
    // Will have to shift indexes once element is removed
    // O(n) for deletion

// Can use linked lists to implement
    // O(1) for deletion
