// Perfect Binary Tree
    // Has all leaf nodes are full
    // No node that has one child its either 0 or more than one
    // The amount of nodes in each level are doubled


// Full Binary Tree
    // A node has either 0 or 2 children but never one child

    // Binary Search Tree
        // lookup = 0(log N)
        // insert = 0(log N)
        // delete = 0(log N)
